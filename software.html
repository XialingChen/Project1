<h1>Software </h1>
<p>there are two different kinds of software: system software and appplication software.</p>
<p>System software is a type of computer program that is designed to run a computer's hardware and application programs. If we think of the computer system as a layered model, the system software is the interface between the hardware and user applications.<br />
Examples of system software:</p>
<ul>
<li> Operating Systems </li>
<li> Language Translator </li>
<li> Linker </li>
<li> Loader</li>
<li> Preprocessors</li>
</ul>

<p>An application program (app or application for short) is a computer program designed to perform a group of coordinated functions, tasks, or activities for the benefit of the user. Examples of an application include a word processor, a spreadsheet, an accounting application, a web browser, a media player, an aeronautical flight simulator, a console game or a photo editor. The collective noun application software refers to all applications collectively. This contrasts with system software, which is mainly involved with running the computer.
Applications may be bundled with the computer and its system software or published separately, and may be coded as proprietary, open-source or university projects.</p>
