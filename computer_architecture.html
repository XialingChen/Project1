<h1>Computer Architecture </h1>
<p1>In computer engineering, computer architecture is a set of rules and methods that describe the functionality, organization, and implementation of computer systems. Some definitions of architecture define it as describing the capabilities and programming model of a computer but not a particular implementation. In other descriptions computer architecture involves instruction set architecture design, microarchitecture design, logic design, and implementation.

 the picture below shows the hierarchy of computer architecture from different levels
 </p>

<p> Level 0 is more about the <strong><em> <a href="hardware source code.html" title="hardware">hardware</a> </em></strong> that how to build a hardware from transistors, circuits and gates, etc.</p>
<p> Level 3-6 is <strong><em><a href="software source code.html" title="software"> software </a></em> </strong>, which consists of system software <a> </a> and application software <a> </a> </p>
<p> Level 1 and 2 is more related to how to convert the human readable source code to the machine code that is executed by the hardware. It is processed by <strong><em> <a href="compiler.html" title="compiler">compiler </a></em></strong> or <strong><em><a href="interpreter.html" title="interpreter">interpreter</a></em></strong><a></a> </p>
